## Synopsis

Type6.js is an open source mathematics library written in Javascript.
Vectors, trigonometry, bezier curves, lerp, random distribution and so on.
Because of the massive work involved, it's not the complete library yet. I'm releasing a first 2D chunck now and will release the rest as soon as it is ready. Starting with all the basic stuff for 3D.

## Code Example

[See basic examples on the dedicated website](http://orbisjs.lcluber.com/#example).

## Motivation

The main purpose of this library is to provide a comprehensive tool for all the projects that require the usual mathematics stuff.

## Installation

To use Type6.js you can download it **[here](http://type6js.lcluber.com/#download)** and learn how to use it **[there](http://type6js.lcluber.com/#example)**.

## API Reference
